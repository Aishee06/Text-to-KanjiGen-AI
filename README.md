# KanjiGen AI: Generate Kanji Characters from English Descriptions🈂️

This project is an exciting journey where I used cutting-edge AI models and hands-on experimentation to generate **novel Kanji characters** from short **English definitions**. The project involves fine-tuning the **Stable Diffusion** model with **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation), integrating both **text and image** inputs, and leveraging the power of **deep learning** to bridge the gap between language and visual art. 🎨🖥️
